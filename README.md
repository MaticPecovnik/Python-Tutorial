# Python-Tutorial

The GitHub repository for the lessons in my Steemit Python Beginners Guide

Each post has its own 2 folders. One folder is ment for .py files of different program I have done for the sake of the post. You can freely use these programs to help you with your homework. The second fodlder is ment for the submittions of your homework that is then in the "competition". The folder is open to all for a week, until the next python guide post. After this it is locked and the homeworks submitted graded and awarded.

Enjoy!
