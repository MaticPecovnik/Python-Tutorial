All submittions should be done in the format:

ChapterI_steem-username.py

Of course you insert your own steem username. For instance for me it would be ChapterI_maticpecovnik.py. Programs not commited in such a way cannot be awarded because I do not know to whom I should send the reward. 

Commit your task by creating a new file and copying your code to the file. Name the file accordingly. The file should be created in the correct folder.
